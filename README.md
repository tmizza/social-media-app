# social media app

## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
create the foundation for a crypto social media website. it should allow users to create a bio, and search for other users, and view other users' bios. create a basic web gui and database back end. 

create placeholders for future functionality that will include connecting a crypto wallet, and making payments to other users of the app. this application will be developed over iterations, so focus on a functional MVP with very minimal functionality and gui.

## Project Plan

### Project Plan for MVP Development

#### **1. Project Overview**
The goal is to build a minimal viable product (MVP) with core functionalities: **User Profiles** and **Search Functionality**. The system will be built using **Node.js** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL). The design will focus on simplicity and iterative development.

---

#### **2. Main Tasks**

**Phase 1: Setup and Initialization**
1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
   - Set up a React app for the frontend.
   - Set up a Node.js server with Express for the backend.
   - Choose and configure a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up `.env` files for environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.

---

**Phase 2: Backend Development**
1. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Define the `Users` collection/table with fields: `id`, `username`, and `bio`.

2. **API Development**:
   - Implement the following endpoints:
     - `GET /users`: Fetch all users or search results.
     - `GET /users/:id`: Fetch a specific user’s bio.
     - `POST /users`: Create a new user profile.
     - `PUT /users/:id`: Update a user’s bio.
   - Add placeholder endpoints for future features (e.g., `/wallet/connect`, `/payments/send`).

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for API endpoints using tools like Jest or Mocha.

---

**Phase 3: Frontend Development**
1. **Page Development**:
   - **Home Page**: Include a search bar and a list of users.
   - **Profile Page**: Display user bio and allow editing for the logged-in user.

2. **Component Development**:
   - **SearchBar**: Handles user search input.
   - **UserList**: Displays search results or all users.
   - **BioForm**: Allows users to create or edit their bio.
   - **BioView**: Displays a user’s bio.

3. **Styling**:
   - Use a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap) for minimal and clean design.

4. **API Integration**:
   - Connect frontend components to backend API endpoints using Axios or Fetch.

---

**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**
1. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test the entire workflow (e.g., creating a profile, searching for users, editing a bio).

2. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel).
   - Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

---

#### **3. Technical Considerations**

**Backend (Node.js):**
- Use **Express.js** for routing and middleware.
- Use **Mongoose** (for MongoDB) or **Sequelize** (for PostgreSQL) for database interactions.
- Implement input validation and error handling for API endpoints.

**Frontend (React):**
- Use **React Router** for navigation between pages.
- Use **React Context** or **Redux** for state management (if needed).
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.

**Database:**
- Choose **MongoDB** for flexibility or **PostgreSQL** for structured data.
- Optimize queries for performance (e.g., indexing for search functionality).

**Security:**
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks.
- Implement authentication and authorization for future iterations.

**Scalability:**
- Design the system to handle future features (e.g., crypto wallet integration, payments).
- Use modular code for easy updates and maintenance.

#### **4. Timeline**

| **Phase**               | **Tasks**                                                                 | **Duration** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1**             | Project setup, environment configuration                                  | 2 days       |
| **Phase 2**             | Backend development (database schema, API endpoints, testing)            | 5 days       |
| **Phase 3**             | Frontend development (pages, components, styling, API integration)       | 7 days       |
| **Phase 4**             | Testing, deployment, and documentation                                  | 3 days       |
| **Total**               |                                                                           | **17 days**  |

---

#### **5. Future Iterations**
1. **Crypto Wallet Integration**:
   - Add endpoints for wallet connection and management.
   - Integrate a crypto wallet SDK (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).

2. **Payment Functionality**:
   - Implement endpoints for sending and receiving payments.
   - Integrate a payment gateway or blockchain-based payment system.

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add user authentication and authorization.
   - Implement notifications and activity tracking.
